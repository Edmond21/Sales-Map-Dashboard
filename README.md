# Sales-Map-Dashboard
I created a heat map showing where most purchases of the product are being shipped in Microsoft Power BI.  The data utilizes the address ID and region ID, and counts how many items were shipped to each specific location.  Playing with the hierarchy will show you shipped items towards countries, states/regions, cities, and even postal codes.
